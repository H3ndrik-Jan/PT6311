Arduino library for interfacing with the PT6311 VFD controller. This is a full implementation for all the features of the IC (like LED's, keypad, switches) and an implementation for displaying data on a 14 segment 12 digit display is added.
The library uses a few functions from Funny59's library and is basically an expanded version of that library ( https://github.com/Funny59/pt6311 ).
